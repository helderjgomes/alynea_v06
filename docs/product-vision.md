# Alynea — Product Vision

## What Alynea Is

Alynea is a calm personal productivity app designed to support thoughtful work and intentional living.

It helps users manage tasks, goals, and habits in a way that emphasizes clarity, continuity, and presence — not urgency, gamification, or optimization theater.

Alynea is built for people who think deeply, plan deliberately, and value focus over volume.

## What Alynea Is Not

Alynea is not:
- A project management tool
- A collaboration or team workspace
- A time-tracking or scheduling system
- A dashboard of metrics and charts
- A motivational or self-help app
- A gamified habit tracker

The product intentionally avoids complexity that creates cognitive load or performance pressure.

## Core Product Principles

### Calm by Design
The interface should feel quiet, spacious, and unhurried. UI elements exist to support content, not compete with it.

### Continuity Over Urgency
Alynea prioritizes long-lived responsibilities and steady progress rather than short-term productivity spikes.

### Content First
Tasks, goals, and notes are the primary surface. UI fades into the background.

### Explicit Structure
Everything has a place. Mental models are clear and stable.

## UX Philosophy

Alynea follows Apple Human Interface Guidelines:
- Clarity: legible typography, strong hierarchy
- Deference: UI never overpowers content
- Depth: subtle layering and spatial relationships

The product should feel closer to Apple Notes or Reminders than to web dashboards or productivity power tools.

## Mental Model

Alynea uses a clear, layered structure:

Life Areas  
→ Goals  
→ Projects  
→ Tasks  
→ Habits  

Life Areas represent stable domains of responsibility.
Goals provide direction.
Projects organize effort.
Tasks represent concrete actions.
Habits support consistency.

This hierarchy is foundational and should remain stable.

## Anti-Features

Alynea will explicitly not include:
- Gamification (streaks, badges, rewards)
- KPI dashboards or analytics
- AI-driven task prioritization
- Social comparison or sharing
- Notifications designed to create urgency
- Complex automation rules

Any feature that adds pressure, noise, or performative productivity is out of scope.
